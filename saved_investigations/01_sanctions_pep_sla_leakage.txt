Saved Investigation: Sanctions/PEP SLA Leakage
// COMMENT: Start strict for precision; relax once for recall.

Parameters:
- lookback = 12 months
- sla_hours = 24
- match_mode = "exact"        # relax once to "fuzzy" if few results
- match_threshold = 0.90      # only if fuzzy
- min_total_amount = 10000
- exclude_accounts = ["TEST%", "TRAINING%", "INTERNAL%"]

Prompt (parameterized):
Detect sanctions/PEP SLA leakage over {{lookback}}.
Criteria:
- Party match: sanctions ({{match_mode}} {{match_threshold}} on name+dob if fuzzy) OR customers.is_pep=true
- SLA breach: no AML_Case within {{sla_hours}} hours
- Thresholds: total_amount >= {{min_total_amount}}
- Exclusions: {{exclude_accounts}}

Output:
- entity_id, entity_name, tx_count, total_amount, first_seen, last_seen, sla_hours_to_case, match_confidence, reason_codes
Visualization:
- timeseries (weekly, MAD anomalies) + priority matrix (risk_today, risk_trajectory)
Audit:
- Include lineage: tables, filters, joins, executed_at, query_hash, config_version
